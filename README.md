Exploration of Shootings Flagged as Murders in NYC using R

This research will analyze the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic). This is a record of the shootings that have occurred in New York City from 2006 through April 27, 2023.  This data includes information about the victim, the perpetrator if known, and incident location. The focus of this research will be to examine the variables associated with shootings that resulted in murder. The data set used in this project is available through DATA.GOV at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic.
